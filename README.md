# Handwritten DigitRecognition Web Application
Deep learning digit recognition web application. Trained model with mnist dataset. Saved model served with Flask.

I had to use black background instead of white because my camera quality is pretty bad and adding patch of random colors at close range. So If you want to try this app and use white background just make sure to add inverting color normalization step to app.py.
